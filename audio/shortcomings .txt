Shortcomings with Python
1. Code is not efficient with large number of files.
2. It is taking longer to process text extraction and audio conversion.
3. Limited number of synthesisers are available in Python.
4. difficult to use in multithreading. Module doesnâ€™t quite behave the way expected.
Need to look for alternate options.
