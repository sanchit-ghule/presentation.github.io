What is speech synthesizer?
Computers have evolved to a great extent in terms of their capabilities. One such interesting capability is the ability to synthesise speech. 
Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer used for speech synthesis is called a speech synthesizer. 
Speech synthesizers can be implemented both in hardware and software. 
Human Computer Interaction through speech is growing rapidly. A good variety of interesting applications are screen readers, virtual assistants and IVR(Interactive Voice Response). 
To put it simple, the functionality of a computer software to convert a text into speech, synthesise it and speak it is called TTS. In addition to simplifying human computer interactions, TTS has opened up numerous possibilities for the print disabled. 
The key benefit TTS holds is that it gives the print disabled people a way to access information and engage in the digital world. Spoken alarms, airport or railway announcements are a few examples where one may have listened to synthesised speech. Interactive voice response systems for customer care is a very common example of a situation where a person interacts with a text to speech system.
