AudioBook Project Results.
Creating audio-books is not only practical but also easily accessible and inexpensive as well as duplicable in different environments such as cassette, CD ROM, the Internet. This is another goal for us to help the blind, and also all students benefit from this.
Audio-Books can be used as instruction materials in every situation and every time without being tied to any place or without other peopleâ€™s help.
Audio-Books produced for blind students can create an environment to provide, enrich, inform, guide and teach subjects completely by creating an environment to learn and also develop independent learning skill to discuss on different course related topics.
The benefits of audio-books in distance education provide an easy, access, low cost and quick change of the content when it is necessary.
Since audio-books are educational tools to support learning, programs can be established with simple vocabulary, supported with music and sound effects.
Audio-Book is not so widespread but inexpensive that its potential in open education contexts is easily overlooked. In subject disciplines such as music, where sound is important for blind students, the use of an audio-book as an educational medium is already well developing. In multimedia packages, sound and images are often combined to with good effect, yet audio-book can sometimes play a similar role at much less cost.
The use of audio-books to support open education can be extended to most disciplines.
